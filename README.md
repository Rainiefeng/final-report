# Final-Report

## Description

This Project for INST 326 uses the https://openweathermap.org/api API to get the daily weather data 
for a specified location inputted. The data pulled includes location, temperature,
humidity and other data depending on the what the user wants. 

And we also make a temperature converter which can conver Kelvin to celsius and fahrenheit. 

The final-project.py file located in this repository, uses the supplied API 
and modules to output the data of the locations wanted.

## Run
A sample program call finalproject.py will use the module to go through all the weather information from the API. You can run it like this:
   
   
       python maryland-bills.py


You will also need to get a openweather API key and store it in a file in this directory called *key.txt*.
